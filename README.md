##Algorithms w/ Fortran

This collection of scripts is motivated by the algorithms presented in the [Algorithms 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) Coursera course taught by Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick of Princeton.  

The language they use to deliver this course is java, but I have little practical use for java in my work.  I would sooner use C or Fortran. C is useful because the Linux kernel and many projects are written in it.  Fortran is useful because many simulation models are written in it, including our income tax microsim at CBO.  At the current time, work responsibilities win out, but I may add C implementations in the future.

Consistent with the implementations considered in the course, the programs developed here will lean heavily on the [object-oriented](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) design framework.
